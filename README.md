# PonGo (Pong-Go)

## Demo Link
In progress

## 💡Inspiration

Inspiration mostly came from Tetr.io which is an online real time multiplayer version of the game Tetris. I chose Pong because it is a simple game that is easy to understand and play.

## 💻What it does

Pongo lets you play Pong with your friends online or locally. You can create a room and invite your friends to play with you.
